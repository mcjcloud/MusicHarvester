# MusicHarvester
A Youtube browser, video to mp3 converter, and downloader

# NOTE
This application no longer works because http://youtubeinmp3.com/, which is a dependency of this application, is no longer up.

### Instructions
1. Use the search bar to find songs (or anything really) on YouTube. Results will show up in a list.
2. Select a song in the list and choose one of the following:
  * Download - downloads the audio of the selected video in mp3 format.
  * Play - plays the video in an embeded page.
  * Play in Youtube - plays the video on the YouTube site. Useful if there are embed restrictions on the song.
  * Play in Browser - plays the video in your default web browser.
3. You can configure a default download destination in the Options menu.
4. Enjoy :)

### Note
* Because Music Harvester uses a free YouTube API key, about 40,000-50,000 requests per day are allowed amongst all users, but it's still free!
* Email me with suggestions or concerns at mcjcloud@outlook.com, or create an issue on github.
* Java 8 or higher required!
